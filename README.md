# Argon2Samples
Examples of Argon2 hashing implementation using third party libraries.

## Abstract 
As of March 2022 **Argon2** is the Top1 [OWASP](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html) recommended algorithm to store user password in databases.

Strictly speaking, Argon2 is a *key derivation function* or *KDF* which are a subset of all the hashing functions.

Argon2 was the winner of [PHC](https://www.password-hashing.net/).

You can find the original C implementation [here](https://github.com/P-H-C/phc-winner-argon2).

This repo contains 3 samples (Python, Golang and Dotnet) on how to integrate Argon2 password hashing into your codebase.

## Usage
Clone this repo and enjoy secure password hashing!

```
git clone https://github.com/R3DRUN3/Argon2Samples.git && cd Argon2Samples
```
